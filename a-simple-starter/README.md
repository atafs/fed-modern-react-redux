### History
- Create a **sample application** by using a boilerplate project
- **Skeleton** of the project
- Modern **JavaScript** tooling
- In our project we have js **files** (components), **libraries** (react, redux) and so on
- Before running the app in the web browser, it needs to be **transpiled** (jsx, ES6 and ES5) using a tool called **webpack backed by babel**
- After webpack and babel get througth, we will **get a single file** (application.js or a similar name) with the **hole application**

- npm: node package manager
